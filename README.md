**Introduction**

Open source extension (plugin) application for [Secret Notes](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sziraki.secretnotes).
The main application is also free and ad free, but not open source. My applications contain minimal permissions, no tracking, no ads etc.

**Important**

Currently, this app has no use by itself, but it is planned to change later.
No icon will be present in the launcher, main application will call this extension when required.
Nothing is persisted on the device by this plugin, main app will handle file storage.

**Permissions**

```
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO" />
```
